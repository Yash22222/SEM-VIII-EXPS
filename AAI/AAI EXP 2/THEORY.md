# Aim - Design and Implementation of a Hidden Markov Model for Outcome Prediction

## Theory

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models used for modeling sequential data where the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with hidden states. These models are widely used in various fields, including speech recognition, finance, and biological sequence analysis.

### Components of a Hidden Markov Model:
1. **States (S)**: A finite set of hidden states representing the system's possible conditions.
2. **Observations (O)**: A set of possible observable symbols emitted by the hidden states.
3. **Transition Probabilities (A)**: The probabilities of transitioning from one state to another.
4. **Emission Probabilities (B)**: The probabilities of an observation being emitted from a particular state.
5. **Initial Probabilities (Ï€)**: The probability distribution over the initial states.

### Working of HMM:
HMMs operate based on the assumption that the probability of a future state depends only on the present state and not on past states. Given a sequence of observations, the model can infer the most likely sequence of hidden states through algorithms such as:
- **Forward Algorithm**: Computes the likelihood of a sequence of observations.
- **Viterbi Algorithm**: Determines the most probable sequence of hidden states.
- **Baum-Welch Algorithm**: Estimates the model parameters when they are not explicitly known.

### Applications of HMM:
- Speech and handwriting recognition
- Bioinformatics (gene sequencing)
- Financial market prediction
- Anomaly detection in cybersecurity

## Conclusion

Hidden Markov Models provide a powerful framework for modeling sequential data where the underlying system states are not directly observable. By leveraging transition and emission probabilities, HMMs can effectively predict outcomes in various applications. The model's strength lies in its ability to estimate hidden states based on observed sequences, making it a valuable tool for sequential data analysis. Future enhancements can include deep learning approaches like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to improve prediction accuracy in complex sequences.
