**Aim:-** Training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Using TensorFlow

### **Theory**

A **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** is a type of generative model that learns to represent data distributions in a latent space, enabling it to generate new, similar data points. VAEs extend traditional autoencoders by incorporating probabilistic constraints, making them more effective for tasks like image generation and anomaly detection.

#### **1. Structure of a Variational Autoencoder**
A VAE consists of two primary components:
- **Encoder:** Compresses input data into a latent space representation, typically a mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution.
- **Decoder:** Reconstructs data from the latent space representation, generating output similar to the input data.

Mathematically, the encoder maps an input \( x \) to a distribution \( q(z|x) \) in the latent space, typically parameterized by a Gaussian distribution with mean \( \mu \) and variance \( \sigma^2 \):
\[
q(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(z; \mu(x), \sigma^2(x))
\]

To enable learning, VAEs use a **reparameterization trick**, where \( z \) is sampled as:
\[
z = \mu + \sigma \cdot \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
\]
This ensures that backpropagation can be used to optimize parameters.

#### **2. Loss Function**
The objective of a VAE is to minimize the reconstruction error and ensure that the latent space follows a known distribution, typically a standard normal distribution. The loss function consists of two terms:
1. **Reconstruction Loss:** Measures how well the decoder reconstructs the original input.
2. **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence:** Regularizes the latent space by ensuring it follows a standard normal distribution.
   \[
   \mathcal{L}_{VAE} = \mathbb{E}_{q(z|x)} [\log p(x|z)] - D_{KL}(q(z|x) || p(z))
   \]

Where:
- \( p(x|z) \) represents the likelihood of the input given latent variables.
- \( D_{KL} \) measures the divergence between the learned latent space and the standard normal distribution.

### **Conclusion**
Variational Autoencoders are powerful generative models that balance accurate reconstruction with meaningful latent space representations. By training on large datasets, VAEs can generate new data samples that resemble the original dataset. VAEs have applications in image generation, data compression, and anomaly detection, making them a fundamental tool in modern deep learning research.
