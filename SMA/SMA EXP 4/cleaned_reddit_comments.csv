Don't u think it's too much of a concern now ???,Deleted/Unavailable,cosmicprincess16,we can literally see  that in this it is written  that the neighbour had to call for help  and that when the spanish guy called  the receiver talked in kannada and cut the phone  so it means that when he called they didnt respond at all  and hence he had to literally make his neighbour call  and yeah that is still wrong  even assuming the police report is true,37

Don't u think it's too much of a concern now ???,Deleted/Unavailable,enigmatic_soul999,"do you have any issues in comprehending things or do you have a habit in interpreting things as you want to hate someone 

police have clearly stated in the press statement the first call was made at 917am and it was disconnected later at 919am a call was made by the spanish citizen where he spoke and gave some info later on the same call the person next to him spoke in kannada told he will call back to provide more info they waited at 1008am the neighbour gave detailed information about the incident and a case was registered and the police was there in 20minutes

is there any where mentioned that the police cut the call and i see no space where a spanish citizen was demanded to speak in kannada i dont know of your eyes are too sharp to identify such things it was clear communication gap which arose due to communication gap with usage of spanish mixed with english at first which even toi has reported as soon as clear information was given the police was there at the house within 20min 

if you still doubt call 112 in bangalore or make any of your friends to speak in kannada english and even hindi they respond all calls go to centralised system and calls are recorded plus after reporting of the case nearest police van will be deployed feedback will be taken of the issue was resolved they have a set system in place unlike many other places",10
