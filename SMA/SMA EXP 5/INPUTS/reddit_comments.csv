I really do wish one day some northern city actually overtakes Bengaluru in IT sector, Delhi is already there I think. And nope the last thing we would do is cry about it. We would be ecstatic brother, trust me. The city would be less conjusted. We are completely fine with mediocre growth. Slow and steady all the way. Regardless of politics here, the state always had its visionaries. So we will do fine regardless. The thing is we have never seen migration to other states as Plan A, the attitude has always been ""build it here, this will be Plan A"".

What must have happened, he tried to talk, the complaint officer didn't understand it, they might be either talking in kannada or asked to speak in kannada, so he gave the phone to his neighbour to complete the procedure and, looks like he never tried calling himself after that ( cause he knew english won't work ) so asked neighbours to register complaint.",2

Police have clearly stated in the press statement the first call was made at 9.17am and it was disconnected. Later, at 9.19am a call was made by the Spanish citizen where he spoke and gave some info. Later on the same call the person next to him spoke in Kannada, told he will call back to provide more info. They waited! At 10.08am, the neighbour gave detailed information about the incident and a case was registered. And the police was there in 20minutes.

Is there any where mentioned that the police cut the call? And I see no space where a Spanish citizen was demanded to speak in Kannada! I don't know of your eyes are too sharp to identify such things! It was clear communication gap which arose due to communication gap with usage of Spanish mixed with English at first (which even TOI has reported). As soon as clear information was given, the police was there at the house within 20min. 

IF you still doubt, call 112 in Bangalore or make any of your friends to speak in Kannada, English and even Hindi. They respond! All calls go to centralised system and calls are recorded. Plus, after reporting of the case nearest police van will be deployed. Feedback will be taken of the issue was resolved! They have a set system in place unlike many other places!",10

If you think this is some language issue you are stupid. Even if we assume the first news is true then it should be a lack of understanding rather than some speak in Kannada or don't call emergency kind a thing. Seriously guys the level you guys stoop to just ignite this language issue is crazy. The majority of people in Bangalore don't really care. You take isolated incidents from auto drivers and make it a big issue. 

I support the fact that you should learn and respect the language of the land you live in. It should be mutual respect. 


Some of the northies we hate are the one who feel entitled and think we all owe them something. ""Hindi national language"" ""You should speak Hindi"" kind of attitude is what I personally don't like. And they are the ones who are spreading this hate. In retaliation we hate and we all burn ourselves by fighting among ourselves. Is that the goal?

We all have hindi as a subject in Karnataka even though there was no necessity for that. We learnt an additional language to have mutual benefits. Learn our language when you stay here for more than 5 years or so. Atleast try.",0

2. Well! I have worked in companies where people from EU are deputed in here for few months on projects. People especially from France, Spain and Germany issues in speaking fluent English. They can manage but struggles a lots of time since their native language is not English. With a different accent and struggling English. It might have been a problem in communication! 

3. Eventually a kannada-speaking person had to speak is what you are portraying! Lets say I was in North India and Iam definitely gonna struggle in Hindi. Incase, if my accent is not something the complaint receiver are able to under in English. I am definitely gonna take help of a localite. No one was discriminated on basis of language!

Police have made counter claim and clearly stated things from their end! If any news agency thinks its false. They are more than welcome to negate it! TOI has rather done the reverse by changing to info from ""Unverified source"". The frustration is because, its not the first time people are just hating all over the state, people on language issue with fake reporting by these entities and people continuing their hate. What happened last month with Cubbon readers? The organisers accused that their books were seized since they did not speak Kannada and they discriminated. Later, the next day authorities released a press release on how the organisation had not seeked permission to organise the event in a public place and despite telling them to vacate. They did not, because of which they had to seize the book temporarily. After the release, the orgnaisers just went mum stating we have come into compromise and we are not going forward with FIR.

In their nations, their local language is given prominence, hence they do struggle with English a bit and they have a entirely different accent which becomes difficult to understand. 

When the Spanish citizen called at 9.19am, he provided some info and later passed on his phone to a guy next to him who was a localite. He spoke and gave information he told he would call back in sometime with more information! (Call operator did not cut the call, rather the one who spoke).

Yes. 1st of all, CEOs are all jerk. They want to make people work 24/7 with peanut salary. I hope their service base company all dies.

3-Their regions most common language.

Don't u think it's too much of a concern now ???,Deleted/Unavailable,NotInterestedForsho,"Oh my, I am giving you a big hug because you sound really unhappy and hopeless for our country. I don't share your inferiority complex. Our experiences are very different from each other, but let me share my own perspective.

>Anyone can but not us

I really wish you work on having better people around you. I personally feel confident about the innovative and creative side of the Indian/South Asian diaspora. Even when you go to countries doing better than India, you will see that a large number of people employed there are ""us"". We don't lack any abilities, we are the workforce of the world at this point.

>I hope their service base company all dies.

Even though I haven't worked in the MNC service industry, I have worked in IT enough to know that they bring value to the world. There is a reason why someone is looking for someone to do that work and paying for it. If indian companies move on (or die) some other country-men will provide the same service. Just that we will stop benefitting from this income as a nation.

>AI does the job for free

I don't think AI companies provide services for 'free' but it will definitely be less expensive than employing humans for things that can be automated. Because the goal of a business is to provide services in the most cost efficient way, employing the cheapest alternative makes most sense. 

>So no innovation

We are a developing nation with families that have no financial safety nets for having a risk appetite. Yes, it would be good if we had a huge population working for and building product based companies. (Btw, those companies will also be based in Bangalore because it's where the bulk of people are presently)

If you compare the experience of an individual of an IT firm versus a non IT firm, it will break your heart. Not just the compensation, but the politics, environment and respect. The evil IT companies still treat their employees better than non IT Product companies.

> If IT dies, parents will have more diverse routes for kids

I can't personally relate to this because being a software developer was my personal choice against my parents' wishes. But, parents are attracted to where the money and stability is, if AI becomes the new money making thing, they will push their kids to have careers in that field. It's not like suddenly making music or art will be a more lucrative career than working for a service based IT company. People are forced to do things that pays the bills at the end of the day.

Also, I think that AI is like a tool for a better world, not the industry itself. All the services AI provides are for humans to consume.

Example: I hate to talk to a chatbot/ivr when I am dealing with other systems like lodging a complaint or ordering something. I try to find the quickest option to switch to a human assistant and then discuss my problem or needs. Unless AI becomes truly indistinguishable from a human, it will reduce the workload of humans and improve efficiency and not take away jobs for the most part. If a company needs 5 support tele-callers today,  it will require 2 with AI support for serving the same amount of requests. 


>AI should take over all the jobs so future kids dont have to worry about jobs for half of their life and enjoy and learn whatever they want to.

Now i don't know if that's a reason enough to warrant studying basic hindi in school till 8th grade. Thats prolly a wholly different discussion


But my personal opinion in this matter is that exposure to language should only be done via soft methods like schooling/industry training. Kannada language should 100% be compulsory in all schools in the state


But these rickshaw bullying and comment wars stereotyping all North Indians and throwing them under the bus has to stop. 
Just the way not every kannadiga is not of the rickshaw driver mindset and are fairly inclusive, not every ""northie"" is an asshole either.

Don't u think it's too much of a concern now ???,Deleted/Unavailable,lexicon435,It is really shitty that locals are resorting to violence and targetting.
