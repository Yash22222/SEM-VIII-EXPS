Cmon guys u know that Bangalore is and always will b great cos of its people. More of u here will only make it like ur place. Have travelled extensively in the north and I have seen not one soul knows anything other than Hindi. And then they talk bout Kannada !! Kannada was d last language I learnt as a Bangalore in my mid twenties. I knew Hindi, Tamil much before learning a word of Kannada . And I am a Malayali! So guys who want to create issues talking bout language bias here are just divisive. U lot are better in ur own state!\n",

Basic courtesy of the newspaper who is spreading these allegation is to defend themselves by giving clarity. Rather, are just telling its unverifiable! I won't trust even a bit what Newsppaer has reported! \n",

            "Police have made counter claim and clearly stated things from their end! If any news agency thinks its false. They are more than welcome to negate it! TOI has rather done the reverse by changing to info from \"Unverified source\". The frustration is because, its not the first time people are just hating all over the state, people on language issue with fake reporting by these entities and people continuing their hate. What happened last month with Cubbon readers? The organisers accused that their books were seized since they did not speak Kannada and they discriminated. Later, the next day authorities released a press release on how the organisation had not seeked permission to organise the event in a public place and despite telling them to vacate. They did not, because of which they had to seize the book temporarily. After the release, the orgnaisers just went mum stating we have come into compromise and we are not going forward with FIR. (As if they are doing a favour). People are just mis using language as tool to convert personal issues into language issues! I can state numerous examples on how they are playing cards for sentiments and defaming to make themselves seen as sane.\n",

I worked in a global corporate office where I used to interact with German and French colleagues on everyday basis. Our English fluency is far better! In their nations, their local language is given prominence, hence they do struggle with English a bit and they have a entirely different accent which becomes difficult to understand. \n",

He spoke and gave information he told he would call back in sometime with more information! (Call operator did not cut the call, rather the one who spoke). So, clearly no one has been forced to speak in Kannada. Chances are the Spanish guy might have given the phone to the localite as he could have make them understand the situation better!\n",

Europe had the same struggle with English. The problem is most people in South associate English with being educated, sophisticated etc while demeaning their own language. Your solution is to teach your kids the matrabhasha from birth till age 7 (reading, writing etc) and then teach other languages from there as an adjunct.\n",

First of all  why should we learn Hindi, yes as you said every inch of land in our country is everyone's home, but diversity is what makes India different from other countries, let it be Kannada, telugu Hindi, Gujarati which ever, those aren't just languages they are a different culture, for example we in Karnataka celebrate Navaratri very Grand in our own style, now a Gujarati guy cannot come and expect us to play garba with him, if we like it we will learn and we will join, if a Gujarati guy come to Bengaluru and wants to celebrate Navaratri with us, then learn how we celebrate and celebrate with us, it works same when I go to Gujarat I would really love to learn garba and celebrate navaratri, this is the simple logic, Let Hindi be most spoken language or anything, we dont use it for daily communication, Languages are for making life comfortable and everyone will the language which makes his/her life comfortable.
