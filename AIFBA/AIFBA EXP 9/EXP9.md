# Aim - Designing and Backtesting Complex Trading Strategies  

## Theory  

A **trading strategy** is a systematic approach to buying and selling financial assets based on predefined rules. Designing a **complex trading strategy** involves integrating **technical indicators, fundamental analysis, and risk management** to optimize profitability.  

**Backtesting** evaluates the strategy's past performance using historical data before real-world deployment.

## Components of a Trading Strategy  

### a) Entry & Exit Rules  
- **Technical Indicators:** Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands.  
- **Chart Patterns:** Head & Shoulders, Double Tops, Trendlines.  
- **Quantitative Models:** Statistical arbitrage, mean reversion, momentum strategies.  

### b) Risk Management  
- **Position Sizing:** Fixed percentage risk per trade (e.g., 2% of capital).  
- **Stop Loss & Take Profit:** Exit conditions to minimize losses and secure profits.  
- **Risk-Reward Ratio:** Typically **1:2** or higher for profitable trading.  

### c) Market Conditions & Adaptability  
- **Regime Switching Models:** Adjust strategy based on market conditions (bullish, bearish, sideways).  
- **Volatility Filters:** Avoid trades in extreme market conditions.

## Backtesting Trading Strategies  

### a) Data Selection  
- **Historical Data:** Includes price, volume, and fundamental metrics.  
- **Data Granularity:** Intraday, daily, weekly, or tick data.  

### b) Performance Metrics  
- **Cumulative Returns:** Total return over the backtest period.  
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Risk-adjusted return measurement.  
- **Max Drawdown:** Largest capital decline during testing.  

### c) Avoiding Overfitting  
- **Out-of-Sample Testing:** Validate on unseen data.  
- **Walk-Forward Analysis:** Adjust parameters dynamically over time.  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Evaluate robustness under multiple market conditions.
