# Experiment 2:- Calculating Sharpe Ratios for Investment Portfolios

## AIM  
Calculating Sharpe Ratios for Investment Portfolios.

## THEORY  
The **Sharpe Ratio** is a widely used financial metric for evaluating the performance of an investment portfolio relative to its risk. It was developed by **William F. Sharpe in 1966** and is a cornerstone of modern portfolio theory.

The **Sharpe Ratio** measures the excess return of an investment (above a risk-free rate) per unit of risk, where risk is represented by the standard deviation of portfolio returns. It helps investors understand whether the returns of a portfolio are due to smart investment decisions or excessive risk.

### Formula for Sharpe Ratio  
\[
S = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
\]  

Where:  
- **S** = Sharpe Ratio  
- **R_p** = Portfolio Return  
- **R_f** = Risk-Free Rate  
- **Ïƒ_p** = Standard Deviation of Portfolio Returns  

## Components of the Sharpe Ratio  

### a) Portfolio Return (\( R_p \))  
- The actual return generated by the investment portfolio over a specific period.  
- Typically calculated as the arithmetic or geometric mean of periodic returns.  

### b) Risk-Free Rate (\( R_f \))  
- The return on a theoretically risk-free investment, usually approximated by short-term government treasury bonds (e.g., U.S. T-bills).  
- Serves as a baseline for comparing portfolio performance.  

### c) Standard Deviation (\( \sigma_p \))  
- Measures the volatility or risk of portfolio returns.  
- Higher standard deviation indicates greater variability and, therefore, higher risk.  

## Interpretation of Sharpe Ratio  
- **Higher Sharpe Ratio:** Indicates that the portfolio delivers more excess return per unit of risk, reflecting better risk-adjusted performance.  
- **Lower Sharpe Ratio:** Suggests that the portfolio may not adequately compensate for the level of risk taken.  
- **Negative Sharpe Ratio:** Implies that the portfolio's return is less than the risk-free rate, indicating poor performance.  

## Application of Sharpe Ratio  

### a) Comparing Investment Options  
- The Sharpe Ratio allows investors to compare different portfolios or funds with varying levels of risk and return.  
- For example, between two portfolios, the one with the higher Sharpe Ratio is preferred if the investor aims for better risk-adjusted performance.  

### b) Portfolio Optimization  
- Portfolio managers use the Sharpe Ratio to balance risk and return, optimizing asset allocation to maximize the ratio.  

### c) Evaluating Fund Managers  
- Investors assess fund managers' ability to generate returns above the risk-free rate while controlling risk.  

## CONCLUSION  
Thus, we have successfully implemented the calculation of **Sharpe Ratios for Investment Portfolios**.
