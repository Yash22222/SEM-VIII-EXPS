# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms  

## Theory  

Fraud detection leverages **Machine Learning (ML) algorithms** to identify anomalous transactions in financial systems. Fraudulent activities often exhibit distinct patterns that ML can recognize, making it a powerful tool for detecting fraud.  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract key variables such as transaction time, amount, location, and frequency.  
- **Handling Imbalanced Data:**  
  - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):** Generates synthetic fraud samples to balance the dataset.  
  - **Undersampling:** Reduces the majority class (non-fraud cases) to balance the dataset.  

### 2. Supervised Learning Models  
- **Logistic Regression:** Acts as a simple baseline model.  
- **Decision Trees & Random Forest:** Effective for analyzing feature importance.  
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM):** Achieves high accuracy on imbalanced datasets.  
- **Neural Networks (Deep Learning):** Captures complex fraud patterns through multi-layered networks.  

### 3. Unsupervised Learning for Anomaly Detection  
- **Isolation Forest:** Detects outliers by isolating rare observations.  
- **Autoencoders (Deep Learning):** Learns normal transaction behaviors and flags anomalies.  

### 4. Model Evaluation Metrics  
- **Precision & Recall:** Focuses on minimizing false negatives to catch more fraud cases.  
- **AUC-ROC Score:** Measures the model's ability to distinguish fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.  

### 5. Real-Time Fraud Detection  
- **Deploy as an API (Flask, FastAPI):** Enables instant fraud detection for financial transactions.  
- **Use Streaming Frameworks (Kafka, Spark):** Allows real-time fraud analysis for large-scale systems.  

## Conclusion  
Thus, we have learned how **Fraud Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms** effectively identifies fraudulent transactions by utilizing supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
