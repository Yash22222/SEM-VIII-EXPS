# AIM: Developing and Backtesting a Simple Trading Algorithm

## THEORY  

- **Simple Moving Averages (SMAs):**  
  An SMA is the average price of an asset over a specific period. It is calculated by adding up the closing prices of the asset over that period and dividing the sum by the number of periods. SMAs help smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends.  
  - A **shorter-term SMA** reacts more quickly to price changes.  
  - A **longer-term SMA** provides a smoother trend indication.  
  - The code calculates two SMAs:  
    - **SMA_Short:** Window of 2 days  
    - **SMA_Long:** Window of 3 days  

- **Trading Strategy: SMA Crossover**  
  - When the **short-term SMA crosses above** the long-term SMA → **Buy Signal (Uptrend)**  
  - When the **short-term SMA crosses below** the long-term SMA → **Sell Signal (Downtrend)**  
  - The idea is to **buy when prices start rising** and **sell when prices start falling**.  

- **Backtesting:**  
  - Backtesting is applying a trading strategy to historical data to evaluate performance.  
  - The code simulates trading based on signals and calculates portfolio value and profit/loss.  
  - **Limitations:** Backtesting results are based on past data and may not reflect future performance.  

- **Assumptions and Considerations:**  
  - **Simplified Model:** Does not account for transaction costs, slippage, or market volatility.  
  - **Parameter Optimization:** SMA window selection impacts strategy performance.  
  - **Risk Management:** Real-world trading requires risk management strategies (not included).  

## Applications  

### 1. Algorithmic Trading  
- **Automated Trading Systems:**  
  - Automates buy/sell decisions based on real-time data.  
  - Reduces emotional bias and improves execution speed.  
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT):**  
  - Identifies short-term price fluctuations and executes trades rapidly.  
  - Requires specialized infrastructure.  

### 2. Portfolio Management  
- **Trend Following:** Identifies trends in stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies.  
- **Risk Management:** Uses SMAs to set trailing stop-loss orders to limit losses.  

### 3. Financial Analysis and Research  
- **Technical Analysis:** Used to find trends, support/resistance levels, and trading opportunities.  
- **Backtesting & Strategy Development:** Evaluates strategy performance on historical data.  

### 4. Other Applications  
- **Inventory Management:** Forecasts demand and optimizes inventory levels.  
- **Economic Forecasting:** Identifies trends in GDP, inflation, etc.  
- **Signal Processing:** Extracts meaningful insights from noisy data.  

## CONCLUSION  
Thus, we have successfully developed and backtested a simple trading algorithm.
